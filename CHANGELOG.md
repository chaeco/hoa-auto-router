## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **HTTP method-only file names**: Files can now be named with just the HTTP method (e.g., `get.ts`, `post.ts`), and the route will be the directory path
- **Prefix array support**: `prefix` parameter now accepts string arrays for registering routes with multiple prefixes
- **Merged configuration support**: `autoRouter` now accepts an array of configurations for cleaner, more concise setup
- Multi-level configuration support: Multiple `autoRouter` instances can now be used with different configurations
- Each configuration maintains independent settings for `dir`, `prefix`, and `defaultRequiresAuth`
- Route metadata automatically accumulates across multiple configurations without overwriting
- Duplicate route detection now works across all configurations and instances
- Added comprehensive test cases for prefix arrays, merged and separate configuration scenarios

### Changed

- `autoRouter` function signature now supports both single object and array of objects
- `prefix` parameter now supports both string and string array types
- Route registry is now shared across all `autoRouter` configurations to prevent duplicate routes
- Updated README with prefix array examples and use cases
- Updated README with merged configuration examples (recommended approach)
- Added documentation for common scenarios using merged configuration: business modules, permission levels, and API versioning
- Updated example code to demonstrate merged configuration pattern
